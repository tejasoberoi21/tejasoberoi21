- 👋 Hi, I’m @tejasoberoi21
- 👀 I’m interested in programming robust algorithms in Java and Python, learning about AI and Machine Learning, and making various applications in languages like React 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a lot of competitive programming to further enhance my algorithmic coding. I am also taking classes and applying to summer progams
to learn some AI and ML because it is very interesting to me.
